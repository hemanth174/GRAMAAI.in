# Patient Portal - Integration Complete ✅

## 🎉 Successfully Integrated Features

The **THINGS** folder files have been successfully integrated into the **PaitentsPage** (Patient Portal) with full backend and frontend connectivity.

## 📦 What Was Integrated

### Backend Components

1. **Database Layer** (`database.js`)
   - SQLite database for appointment management
   - Full CRUD operations for appointments
   - Automatic schema migrations
   - Data normalization and validation

2. **API Server** (`server.js`)
   - Express.js REST API server
   - Real-time Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live updates
   - CORS enabled for frontend connectivity
   - Runs on **Port 5001** (separate from Hospital backend on 5000)

### Frontend Components

1. **API Client** (`src/api/appointmentClient.ts`)
   - TypeScript client for appointment operations
   - Real-time SSE connection management
   - Auto-reconnect on disconnection
   - Event listener system for updates

2. **Toast Notifications** (`src/utils/toast.ts`)
   - Standalone notification system
   - No external dependencies
   - Success, error, info, and warning types
   - Customizable position and duration

3. **Booking Form Integration** (`src/pages/book-appointment/page.tsx`)
   - Connected to backend API
   - Real-time appointment creation
   - Backend connection status indicator
   - Multi-step form with validation

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd PaitentsPage
npm install express cors sqlite3 sqlite
```

Or run the install script:
```bash
install-backend.bat
```

### 2. Start the Backend Server

```bash
node server.js
```

Or use the batch file:
```bash
start-backend.bat
```

**Backend will run on: http://localhost:5001**

### 3. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or use the batch file:
```bash
start-frontend.bat
```

**Frontend will run on: http://localhost:5173**

### 5. Start Everything at Once

```bash
START-ALL.bat
```

This will start both backend and frontend automatically!

## 📡 API Endpoints

All endpoints are available at `http://localhost:5001/api/`

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/appointments` | List all appointments |
| GET | `/api/appointments/stream` | Real-time SSE updates |
| POST | `/api/appointments` | Create new appointment |
| PATCH | `/api/appointments/:id` | Update appointment |
| DELETE | `/api/appointments/:id` | Delete appointment |
| GET | `/health` | Health check endpoint |

## 💡 How to Use

### Booking an Appointment

1. Navigate to the **Book Appointment** page
2. Select consultation type (Online/In-Person/Emergency)
3. Choose medical specialty
4. Select a doctor
5. Pick date and time
6. Fill in patient information
7. Click "Book Appointment"

The appointment is automatically:
- ✅ Saved to the database
- ✅ Synced with Hospital Dashboard (via shared backend)
- ✅ Broadcasted to all connected clients in real-time

### Real-Time Updates

The system uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates:

```typescript
import { appointmentClient } from '@/api/appointmentClient';

// Connect to real-time updates
appointmentClient.connectToUpdates();

// Listen for specific events
appointmentClient.addEventListener('created', (appointment) => {
  console.log('New appointment:', appointment);
});

appointmentClient.addEventListener('updated', (appointment) => {
  console.log('Updated appointment:', appointment);
});

appointmentClient.addEventListener('deleted', (appointment) => {
  console.log('Deleted appointment:', appointment);
});

// Disconnect when done
appointmentClient.disconnect();
```

## 🔗 Integration with Hospital Dashboard

The Patient Portal and Hospital Dashboard can communicate through two approaches:

### Option 1: Shared Backend (Current Setup)
- Both portals connect to the same backend server
- Real-time sync via SSE
- Appointments created in Patient Portal appear instantly in Hospital Dashboard

### Option 2: Independent Backends
- Each portal has its own backend
- Sync via webhooks or message queue
- Better scalability and separation of concerns
